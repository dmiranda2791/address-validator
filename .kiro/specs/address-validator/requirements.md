# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Address Validator is a backend API service that validates and standardizes property addresses in free-form text format. The service accepts unstructured address input and returns a structured, validated version with components like street, number, city, state, and zipcode. The system is designed to handle US addresses only and gracefully manages edge cases such as partial addresses and typos while providing clear validation status indicators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to submit a free-form address string to a validation endpoint, so that I can receive a structured and validated address response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /validate-address with address data THEN the system SHALL accept the request and process the address
2. WHEN the request contains a valid address string THEN the system SHALL return a structured response with street, number, city, state, and zipcode fields
3. WHEN the request is malformed or missing required data THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response with status code 400

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to know the validation status of my address, so that I can understand whether the address was valid, corrected, or unverifiable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an address is successfully validated without changes THEN the system SHALL return status "valid"
2. WHEN an address is corrected during validation THEN the system SHALL return status "corrected" and include both original and corrected versions
3. WHEN an address cannot be verified THEN the system SHALL return status "unverifiable" with available partial data
4. WHEN validation fails completely THEN the system SHALL return status "invalid" with error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the service to handle partial or incomplete addresses gracefully, so that I can still receive useful information even with limited input data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a partial address is provided THEN the system SHALL attempt validation and return available structured components
2. WHEN required address components are missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which components could not be determined
3. WHEN the address contains typos or minor errors THEN the system SHALL attempt correction and indicate the changes made

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to be resilient to external API failures, so that temporary outages don't cause complete service failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the external validation service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff plus jitter
2. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response indicating service unavailability
3. WHEN the external service returns rate limiting errors THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and retry appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the validation service to be easily configurable for different providers, so that I can switch between validation services without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured with a different validation provider THEN the system SHALL use the new provider without requiring code changes
2. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL use the configured primary provider
3. WHEN the validation provider interface changes THEN the system SHALL isolate these changes through the adapter pattern

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the service to restrict validation to US addresses only, so that I receive consistent and relevant results for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-US address is submitted THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating US addresses only are supported
2. WHEN an address format suggests non-US origin THEN the system SHALL validate against US address standards only
3. WHEN the validation service detects international formatting THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate messaging
